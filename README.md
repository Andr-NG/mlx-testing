# MLX API Testing
Sort of a POC for testing MLX API with Python and Pytest. The suite covers a simple scenario of signing up an account, assigning a plan, creating and launching a profile in **DEV** by default.

# Structure
* /API - files with API clients.
* /data - various files with test data and general data.
* /models - Pydantic models generated by OpenAPI Generator.
* /tests - folder with the tests and conftest.py
* /utils - folder with additional functions.

# Usage
Before running the suite, make sure :
* to install all the required packages and dependecies:
    >pip install - r requirements.txt
* to set the correct yaml.file for Launcher with the following content:
    > - LogLevel: debug Log 
    > - Console: true 
    > - GwEnv: dev
* to include .env with the passwords to the envs.    
* to keep Launcher running.
